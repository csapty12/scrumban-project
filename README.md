# ScrumBan
This is a small project, to learn about using Java Spring Boot, with React.js and Redux.js.

# How To Use:
When you pull the project, the master branch only contains the ReadMe file. if you want to see the frontend client, please checkout the branch named "scrumban-frontend". To view the backend, use the branch "scrumban-backend".



# The Idea
The idea is to create similar CRUD functionalities to what applications such as JIRA or TRELLO use, such that I can create my own scrum / kanban board.

It will consist of features including:
- creating a user
- logging in as a user
- Create new project
- Read the project contents (which would consist of ticket)
- Update current project
- Delete a project

The front end will have a similar look to Jira, created using React.js component, and Redux.js to store application state such as JWT's.
