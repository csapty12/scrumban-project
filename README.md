# ScrumBan
This is a small project, to learn about using Java Spring Boot, with React.js and Redux.js.

The idea is to create similar CRUD functionalities to what applications such as JIRA or TRELLO use, such that I can create my own scrum / kanban board.

It will consist of features that include:
- creating a user
- logging in as a user
- Create new project
- Read the project contents (which would consist of ticket)
- Update current project
- Delete a project

The front end will have a similar look to Jira, created using React.js component, and Redux.js to store application state such as JWT's.
